# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

**EuGo-docint** (*EuGo Document Intelligence*) — an independent, **stateless, cluster-internal document-understanding service**: files in → Markdown, tables with typed numeric cells, image descriptions, per-file warnings/errors out. It renders no compliance judgment and stores nothing. It is called by EuGo-Web (and later EuGo-mcp) over `POST /v1/extract` on a shared AKS cluster, and is never exposed via ingress.

The build plan and spec live in the sibling Obsidian vault; the approved service design lives in this repo:

- Service design (authoritative for T1–T6): `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-eugo-docint-design.md`
- Plan (task level, T1–T8): `../EuGo-Obsidian/plans/eugo-docint-plan.md`
- Spec (Decision 12): `../EuGo-Obsidian/plans/Plan-A-Step-1/12-decision-eugo-docint.md` — **amended 2026-07-19**: the "no Aspire AppHost" dev-loop note is superseded; the solution uses .NET Aspire (AppHost + ServiceDefaults) per user directive.

Sibling repos: `../EuGo-mcp` (conventions to mirror — its `CLAUDE.md` is the reference), `../EuGo-web` (the consumer), `../EuGo-infra`.

**Tech stack:** .NET 10 · ASP.NET Core minimal API · `Azure.AI.DocumentIntelligence` (Layout → Markdown) · OpenXML (XLSX typed cells) · Azure OpenAI Foundry utility model (image description) · OTel + Serilog · Docker → ACR → AKS.

## Commands

The solution will live at `src/DocInt.slnx` (not the repo root) — always target it explicitly:

```bash
dotnet restore src/DocInt.slnx
dotnet build --no-restore src/DocInt.slnx
dotnet test --no-build src/DocInt.slnx
```

That exact three-step sequence, in that order, is the enforced gate before any merge — `--no-restore` / `--no-build` keep the signal honest (a test failure is a test failure, not a stale build).

Run a single test: `dotnet test --no-build src/DocInt.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestName"`.

Run the app two ways: `dotnet run --project src/AppHost` (Aspire dashboard + OTLP telemetry, preferred for dev) or `dotnet run --project src/DocInt.Api` directly on `http://localhost:8090` (8089 belongs to the siblings). Credentials via user-secrets/env locally (endpoint without key → `DefaultAzureCredential`), Workload Identity on AKS. Config keys: `DocumentIntelligence:*`, `AzureOpenAI:*`, `DocInt:*` — see the design doc's table.

## Architecture

Planned layout (locked by the plan — keep the decomposition):

```
src/DocInt.slnx
├─ DocInt.Api/          ASP.NET Core minimal API (net10.0)
│  ├─ Contracts/        request/response DTOs + OpenAPI
│  ├─ Engines/          EngineRouter · LayoutEngine · SpreadsheetEngine · VisionEngine
│  ├─ Validation/       size/type caps, kind detection
│  └─ Telemetry/        Serilog config, pages-processed metric
├─ AppHost/             Aspire orchestrator (Aspire.AppHost.Sdk/13.1.0), resource "docint"
└─ ServiceDefaults/     stock Aspire defaults (OTel, health, resilience)
tests/DocInt.Tests/     contract + golden-file tests (env-gated live smoke)
└─ golden/              text PDF · scanned PDF · DOCX · PPTX · HTML · BoM XLSX · photo · corrupt file
tools/make-golden/      one-off generator for the golden fixtures
Dockerfile              chiseled aspnet, multi-arch (amd64/arm64), mirrors EuGo-mcp's (port 8090)
```

K8s manifests (`deploy/`) are **not** in this repo — deployment is owned by EuGo-infra.

**Contract v1** (frozen at T2; `/v1` is internal-may-change until EuGo-mcp becomes the second consumer):
`POST /v1/extract` — multipart, N files + per-file hints (filename, content type, optional purpose hint e.g. `bom`, `photo`) → synchronous
`200 { files: [ { name, kind, markdown?, tables?, imageDescription?, warnings[], error? } ] }` with `kind ∈ pdf | docx | pptx | html | xlsx | image`.

**Engines** — all implement the internal seam `IExtractionEngine`, kind-keyed behind `EngineRouter`:

| Kind | Engine |
| --- | --- |
| PDF (incl. scanned), DOCX, PPTX, HTML | DI `prebuilt-layout` → Markdown |
| XLSX | OpenXML typed cells + Markdown rendering (`tables` carries the typed rows — numeric fidelity is the point) |
| JPG/PNG | Vision description via Foundry utility model — **factual observations only**, no classification language |

**Task order:** T1 scaffold → T2 contract/stubs (freezes the wire contract), then T3 layout · T4 spreadsheet · T5 vision in parallel; T6 hardening; T7 AKS deploy (blocked on infra). EuGo-Web integration (T8) proceeds against T2's stubs and lives in the EuGo-Web plan.

## Hard constraints (from the spec — apply to every change)

- **Facts, never meaning.** Document-level language only: no `EvidenceBundle`, no categories, no compliance/classification semantics anywhere in the API or code.
- **Stateless & storage-free.** Bytes in, results out; no document persistence; docint must never grow into a document store.
- **No document content in logs** — filenames and sizes are fine, content never. Serilog gets a content-redaction rule (T6).
- **Per-file success/failure inside a 200.** One corrupt file yields its own `error` entry, never a failed call; request-level errors only for malformed requests (400).
- **EU-region Azure resources only**; Workload Identity on AKS; never secrets in source or tracked config.

## Conventions (mirror EuGo-mcp)

- **Workflow per task:** cut a per-step branch → TDD (failing test first) → `restore` → `build --no-restore` → `test --no-build` → merge to `main` once green → delete the branch. Never develop directly on `main`; never merge red.
- The `.claude/agents/dotnet-developer.md` agent encodes the full PR-based variant (four-section PR bodies, `agent/<slug>` branches); use it for dispatched tasks. When the plan's lighter merge-to-main flow and the agent's never-merge rule conflict, the plan's flow wins for routine steps unless the user asks for PRs.
- Don't skip or weaken tests over missing infrastructure (no Azure credentials, no Docker) — run the subset that can execute and list what was blocked. Live-smoke tests are env-gated by design.
- Testing is golden-file driven: contract tests assert response shapes with Azure stubbed; the env-gated live smoke suite proves OCR (scanned PDF), numeric fidelity (BoM XLSX), and lens/UV cues on the photo.
- `net10.0`, `Nullable` and `ImplicitUsings` enabled across projects.
- **Use the Context7 MCP server for documentation lookups** (Azure.AI.DocumentIntelligence, OpenXML, Azure OpenAI, ASP.NET Core) rather than memory — version-accurate docs matter here.
